+ Project summary: The project creates prediction models to predict the risk of strokes according to the Stroke Prediction Dataset from kaggle. The dataset is extremely imbalanced due to the small proportion of stroke cases. To ensure the ability to identify stoke risk, we used different methods to balance the dataset including modifying class weight and oversampling techniques. At the end of the project, we create a table comparing performance metrics of the models and lead to a conclusion on model selection.
