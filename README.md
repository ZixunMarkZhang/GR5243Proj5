+Project summary: The project creates prediction models to predict the risk of strokes according to the Stroke Prediction Dataset from kaggle. The dataset is extremely imbalanced due to the small proportion of stroke cases. To ensure the ability to identify stoke risk, we used different methods to balance the dataset including modifying class weight and oversampling techniques. At the end of the project, we create a table comparing performance metrics of the models and lead to a conclusion on model selection.
+Contribution statement: All six of us contributed equally in the project. We worked together on data cleaning, and data wrangling, model building, and model assessment. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contribution statement.
